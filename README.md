This project involves developing a simple and intuitive To-Do List application using Angular. The app will allow users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks to their list, edit tasks they have already added, and delete tasks they no longer need. Additionally, users will have the ability to mark tasks as completed, with completed tasks being visually differentiated from those still pending.
